/** Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations
  * between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (nodes) which are
  * connected by edges (arcs or lines). A graph may be undirected, meaning
  * that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with
  * each edge, or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another.
  * Directed graphs are also called digraphs and directed edges are also
  * called arcs or arrows.
  *
  * A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges
  * (also called parallel edges), that is, edges that have the same end
  * nodes. The ability to support parallel edges simplifies modeling
  * scenarios where there can be multiple relationships (e.g., co-worker
  * and friend) between the same vertices.
  *
  * In a property graph, the generic mathematical graph is often extended
  * to support user defined objects attached to each vertex and edge.
  * The edges also have associated labels denoting the relationships,
  * which are important in a multigraph.
  *
  * Unicorn supports directed property multigraphs. Each relationship/edge
  * has a label and optional data (any valid JsValue, default value JsInt(1)).
  *
  * Unicorn stores graphs in adjacency lists. That is, a graph
  * is stored as a BigTable whose rows are vertices with their adjacency list.
  * The adjacency list of a vertex contains all of the vertexâ€™s incident edges
  * (in and out edges are in different column families).
  *
  * Because large graphs are usually very sparse, an adjacency list is
  * significantly more space-efficient than an adjacency matrix.
  * Besides, the neighbors of each vertex may be listed efficiently with
  * an adjacency list, which is important in graph traversals.
  * With our design, it is also possible to
  * test whether two vertices are adjacent to each other
  * for a given relationship in constant time.
